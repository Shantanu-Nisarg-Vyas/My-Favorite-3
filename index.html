        <h3> My Hobbies </h3>
        <p> 1. Playing with my Brother: I like to play a lot with my brother. He is my best friend. I play various things with him.</p>

        <p> 2. Maths: I like solving Maths sums. Maths is my favorite subject at school. Unlike other subjects, (except grammar) random sums can come, which I like a lot. I get full marks in Maths many times. My dad teaches advanced maths, and I also sometimes solve them in advanced Math workbooks.</p>

        <p> 3. Reading Books: I love to read books too. Books are a good source of general knowledge. I also like storybooks, especially ones that have stories that I have never heard. I love stories and general knowledge a lot. </p>

        <p> 4. Coding: I love coding also. I plan to build good games and apps in the future. </p>

        <p> These were just some of my FAVORITE hobbies. I also like playing music, cycling, playing cricket etc. </p>
